title: Conference Reports are here!
---

Transparent Classroom is now equipped for Conference Reports! Currently we have two examples (lesson summary and skills by area) that you can use if you'd like. Or, you can email us a conference form that you would like to use and we'll create a template for you. Also, you can check out other schools' templates, copy them to your school, and tweak them for your own use.

Once your school has chosen its conference reports, go to any child's page, click on 'Documents' and select 'add conference report'. From this page, you can select the template you want to use, the time period it covers, and see a preview. When you're ready to fill in the report select 'generate report'. The report is saved to the child's page under 'Documents' and can be accessed at any time by the guide. Once the report is saved, parents can view it from the same place on their child's page, or you can print it out. 

Here are a couple examples:

The Skills by Area template is a list of skills gained in each area with room to mark how the child is doing. The data is not auto-populated but is filled in by the guide.

The Lesson Summary template generates lessons that the child has had for a chosen time range, and gives space to add narratives about the child.
