title: Lesson Names

Not only are lesson names are a bit picky in Transparent Classroom, they are also one of the first things you need to understand when you want to import your own lessons.

Let's start with how lessons are structured. You can see that the lessons here are organized by area, group, and subgroups. The area is Mathematics, the groups + subgroups are the dark blue rows, and the lessons are in white.

There are a couple guidelines to follow when naming lessons.

## 1. Lesson names must be self explanatory + unique. 

In Transparent Classroom, you will often type only the name of a lesson. If you need the group or the area to understand which lesson it is, that will be confusing. So avoid lesson names like "Introduction" or "Symbol", and include a bit more like "Introduction to Fractions" and "Wooden Hierarchy Material: Symbol"

## 2. Use colons to separate lessons/materials and sublessons. 

For example:
|Sun and Earth: Time Zones|
|Sun and Earth: Unequal Day and Night|
|Sun and Earth: 24 Hour Day or Night at the Poles|

This is important because, when you are using Transparent Classroom in the future, you will type a lesson name and you will first ONLY see the part before the colon. After you hit tab, you will see the sublessons. So the part before the colon should be what you would think to type first.
