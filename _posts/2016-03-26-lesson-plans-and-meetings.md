title: Elementary Record Keeping with Planning by Day + Meetings Notes
---
Over the last year, we have been talking to many of you elementary guides about how we could better serve you.

We heard that you wanted better group support in their classrooms, that you planned by the day, and that meetings (aka student conferences) played a big role in your record keeping.

This is our answer (skip to the bottom to watch it in a video).

## Interactive Lesson Plans by Day

We have a new format for elementary lesson plans that allows you to drag planned lessons into the day of the week you intend to present them. You can also add lessons + children to your plan from the same page. 

Not only can you craft your plan your plan here, you can also execute it. After you've presented a lesson, just check the box and Transparent Classroom will mark it as given!

## Meeting Notes

Each elementary child now has a place to store notes about their meetings. You can put agreements, plans, directions, whatever you want here. It keeps the relevant ones front and center, and you can just check the box to archive one when it's no longer relevant.

In addition, we also show the lesson plan for just this child on the same page page. You can interact with it as you would on the class lesson plan, moving lessons to other dates or adding them. You can also drag a lesson from the notes to the plan when you're ready.

To really get a feel for the new features, watch them in action, then try them out!
