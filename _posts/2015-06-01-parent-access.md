title: Controlling Parent Access

We think that working toward transparency with your parent community is really important, not just for the parents, but also for Montessori as a movement. We think it's part of creating not just Montessori children, but Montessori families.

That said, only you can know the right level of transparency for your community. And we want to support your decision by making Transparent Classroom easy to configure. Here's how:

----

## Private observations

You can always mark an observation as private. This means parents can't see it. If you later mark it public, they'll then be able to see it.

You can also make observations private by default in this activity page or in the grid page. 

This is configured on the classroom edit page.

1. go to the home screen
1. click on "(See All)" by CLASSROOMS on the top left
1. click "(edit)" by the classroom you want to change.

You can have observations default to private for this classroom on the activity page. You can also make observations from the grid page be private.

## Hiding the child lessons page

This is the child lessons page. Parents love this page, and tell us it gives them a better appreciation for the 3/6 year progression that their child is in with Montessori.

That said, some schools are uncomfortable with parents being able to look at this at any time. In the future we are planning on allowing you to generate a report with this information so that you can control when parents see it. Right now, you can choose to hide the page.

This is configured on the lesson set (primary, elementary, etc) edit page. 

1. go to the home screen
1. click on "Lesson Sets" on the left admin section (You'll need to be an admin)
1. click "Edit" by the lesson set you want to change.

We know these have been important features for schools to get started and to feel comfortable. They have also allowed schools to invite parents to use the tool for seeing pictures, and reports. We hope this works for you!
