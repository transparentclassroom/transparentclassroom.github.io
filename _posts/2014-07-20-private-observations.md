title: Private observations
---
By popular request, you can now mark any observation as "private". This will keep parents from seeing it, but it will still be visible to all staff.

This was hard for us. We fundamentally want to push the Montessori movement toward more transparency with parents. But we were seeing some schools that just couldn't make share all their observations, and instead just didn't invite parents.

We hope with this feature that you feel good about sharing non-private observations and pictures with parents to get the full value of Transparent Classroom.
