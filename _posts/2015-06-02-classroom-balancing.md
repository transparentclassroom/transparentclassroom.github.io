title: Classroom Balancing

Welcome our new Classroom Balancing page! 

It lets you see current + potential children, and assign them to appropriate classrooms for the next session (2015-16, etc) while balancing age + gender.

We've tried to really streamline this process. 

Moving a child is as simple as chosing a dropdown. The gender / age balance at the top will automatically update.

## Applications

We have customizable online applications. If you choose to use them, they will feed right into classroom balancing.

Want to figure out which children to accept? Just click on the "Applications" tab.

Here you can play "what-if?" by assigning potential children to classrooms and seeing how they affect balance.

Keep track of application workflow with statuses ("Ready", "In Waitlist", "Offered", "Accepted", etc). After you decide to accept a child, we can also import their information along with their parents from their application. 

## Take a tour

We have a new feature on some of our pages, including this one - "Tours". Click the tour button and we'll show you around the page.

Lastly, we aren't sure that "Classroom Balancing" is the right name for this page. If you think of a better one, let us know!
