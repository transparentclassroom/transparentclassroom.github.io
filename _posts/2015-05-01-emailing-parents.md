title: Emailing parents is easy!
---

Ever wanted to email the parents of several of the children, but had to lookup their emails, copy/paste them to your mail client, and hope that they are the current ones?

Transparent Classroom can help! This is one of our least known features, though one that can save you loads of time.

Just go to the classroom -> children page, select the children whose parents you want to email, and then select "email parents" from the action bar. If they've setup their cell phone + provider, you can even text them.

## But then nothing happens... :(

If your chrome is not setup correctly, you'll also need to do some of the following...

(We are assuming you're using chrome, and highly advise you to be using chrome, as that's where we do all of our testing...)

## Setting up chrome to send email

Copy this link to your address bar and choose your email client from the list : 

[chrome://settings/handlers](chrome://settings/handlers)

For example, if you use gmail, it should look like this:

That didn't work for me, though, I had to first go to gmail.com where there was an icon on the address bar that I had to click (the double diamond) to first allow gmail to be setup.

Hopefully that gets you able to email parents (and soon staff!) from Transparent Classroom.
