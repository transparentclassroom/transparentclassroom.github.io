title: Common Core Standards

We now have the common core in Transparent Classroom.

We have imported the actual standards, and have taken a pass at mapping them to our Primary AMI lessons. We have also made it easy for you to : 

- map your primary / elementary lessons to the standard
- see a child's progress against the standard relative to their mapped lessons
- share a child's progress with parents in a conference report.

## Mapping lessons

We have mapped our primary lessons to the Common Core Grade Kindergarten standards. To the extent that you have our primary lessons, you've probably inherited that. If you want to amend it, add your own lessons, or take a stab at Elementary lessons, you can.

1. go to home screen
1. in the admin section, click on "Standards" (you must be an admin)
1. choose the standards (CCSS Math...) you want to map
1. for any standard, you can see / change which lessons are mapped to it

## See child's progress toward standard

To see a child's progress (basically to get a preview of what the report will look like)...

1. go to child's profile page
1. click on "Standards"
1. choose the standards (CCSS Math...) you want to see
1. you can then see how a child is doing on their mapped lessons, and even update that progress

## Conference Reports

To share this with parents, you can create a conference report. 

The report will show you the child's progress on mapped lessons, while allowing the guide to have the final say of whether a standard is met or not, as well as attach notes.

Like all conference reports, you'll first need to figure out your school's template. Which grades do you want on it? What other information? Do you want a space for narratives, etc. You can see what it looks like by looking at another schools' reports (home -> design: conference reports -> templates from other schools -> common core K+1st).

Once you have the report template, you generate just like any other conference report.

1. go to child's profile page
1. click "Conference Reports"
1. click "Add Conference Report"
1. choose the report + click "Generate report"
1. fill in extra information

## Other Standards

There's nothing special about the Common Core. If you would like to map other standards to your school, talk to us, and we can make that happen.
