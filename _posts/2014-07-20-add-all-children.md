title: Add all children in a classroom to an observation
---

At [Lighthouse Montessori](http://lighthousemontessori.com), we often use Transparent Classroom to share information with parents. But it was frustrating to have to type in the name of every child in an announcement, or in the 10 class pictures we took.

But now you don't have to!

If you type "@AllChildren" it will replace it with all the current children in your classroom, letting you edit the list before saving. 

Have fun...
