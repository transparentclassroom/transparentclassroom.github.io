title: "Customizing Lesson Scales (Introduced, Mastered, ..)"
---

Many of our guides have asked to customize our scales for lessons (Introduced, Mastered, Needs More, ...) when recording child progress with lessons.  And now you can! 

This means you can finally do things like:

- Add Practiced to masterable lessons
- Add Re-Presented as a lesson proficiency
- Change "Mastered" to be something else

## How do you do it?

You'll need to be or find an admin to change your lesson scales. Then go to:

Admin > Lesson Sets > Settings > Check the box that says Customize Scales.

## What can you customize?

After you have selected Customize Scales, the option to edit will appear. You can choose the name for each level of proficiency for Masterable Lessons as well as Ongoing Lessons.

You can add up to six levels of proficiency or leave some fields blank.

The names on your scale are now keywords when recording lessons from the Activity Page:

And your new color coded key will show on the Progress and Plan page:

<a href="/img/screen-shots/customizing-scales-4.png"><img src="/img/screen-shots/customizing-scales-4.png" style="max-width:100%;"/></a>

We hope you enjoy the new customizable lesson scales and let us know if you have any questions!
