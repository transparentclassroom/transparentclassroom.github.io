## How do you do it?

Start by creating a Google Spreadsheet.  You will need a Gmail or Google account to work with Google Applications like Google Sheets. Then go to: 


Drive.google.com > New > Google Sheet


Name your document, (e.g. Parent Teacher Conferences) and create your spreadsheet.  

- You might want to make columns for the Date, Conference Time, and Child Name.  
- Fill in the dates and times available for conferences in separate rows.  
- You can even create colored rows and alternate alignement in time column for easy use!
 

Formatting is similar to Excel and other spreadsheet programs, and Google saves all of your changes as you go.

## Connect Your Spreadsheet to Transparent Classroom

When you've finished creating your document, you'll want to add it to a "Page" for parents in Transparent Classroom. First, create a link to your document. In Google Sheets, go to: 


File > Publish to the Web > Click Embed > Publish > Are you sure you want to publish?  Click Ok. > Type Command or Control-C to Copy Link

<a href="/img/screen-shots/parent-teacher-conferences-publish.png"><img src="/img/screen-shots/parent-teacher-conferences-publish.png" style="max-width:100%;"/></a>

Next, open an new tab and go to: 


Your Transparent Classroom Home Page > Under Pages, Select All Pages > Add Page 
 
Next, name your page and paste the link from Google Sheets into the body. You’ll need to create a bit of image formatting to help your link display properly.  You can copy and paste or type this text --> width="100%" height="800px" <-- into your HTML with the exact placement shown below.

Your Transparent Classroom Home Page > Next to Pages Click Edit > Type *“Your Page Name”:/pages
