title: Onboarding Parents
---
Onboaring parents to Transparent Classroom can seem like a big task, but it's actually very easy and straightforward.

We recommend:

1. Send an introductory email [like this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QZNpp0iOrizKzWVLU9kNNoyJhv1bF4wffj5TmsGwbs4/edit?pli=1) to your parent community.
2. Invite parents to Transparent Classroom (see below for more info).
3. Have a parent night where you can set some expectations about what parents might see (see below).

## Adding Parents

Go to the child's page and select 'add' next to 'Parents'.

Select 'new' if the parent is not already in the system or 'existing' otherwise.

Input parent's first and last name and email - select 'Private' next to email if you think parents would prefer not to share their email with other parents. Then press "Create".

Parents will receive an email inviting them to log on to Transparent Classroom to create their profile and see their child's page. They will be able to keep their contact information up to date and see as much of their child's information as you've decided to share with them.

## Setting Expectations

Why not have a parent education night where you introduce Transparent Classroom and tell parents what they can expect?

If you choose to have parents see all the lessons and entries on Transparent Classroom, it may be useful to talk to them about the sequencing and age-appropriatness of the lessons and why they're given when they are. For example, we have found it useful to talk to parents about indirect preparations in Practical Life and Sensorial activites that set the child up to be successful in the Math activities. You might use an information sheet [like this](/docs/parent_expectation_sheet.pdf) to do so.

We have also found [Sequence Charts like these](http://www.voilamontessori.com/en/free-resources/) helpful in illustrating the flow of Montessori lessons for parents.

## Problem Solving

If a parent is having trouble setting up their profile or navigating the site, check out [our suggestions](https://transparentclassroom.com/faq#user-management) for addressing that. If you still can't solve the problem you can reach out to Jeremy or send the parent his way.
