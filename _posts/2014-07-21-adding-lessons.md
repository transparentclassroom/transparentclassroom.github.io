title: Adding Lessons

A new school asked how to add lessons today, and I recorded my answer in a screencast here:

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
  <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/X0WZrOc7Sxs?controls=2&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


We are eager to add more help + documentation to the app. Right now, it's mostly manual, [email Katrina](mailto:katrina@transparentclassroom.com) and she's always happy to do some free virtual training.
