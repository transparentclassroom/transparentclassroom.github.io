We've been promising this for a while, but we're finally done with a bunch of form improvements.

They include:

1. Better, more intuitive form designer.
1. Ability to map from/to fields in child's profile.
1. Batch assigning forms + batch notification of parents.


Now, you're probably thinking either "Awesome, how does it work?" or "That sounds interesting, but I've never even seen forms..."

In either case, we have a short video for you to watch. It walks you through designing a form, mapping fields, assigning the form, filling it out, and managing it.
