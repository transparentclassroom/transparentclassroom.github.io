Summer is fast approaching and we want to ensure your transition is smooth. There are a few items that you want to make sure happen at the end of every school year or summer session. Here is a quick overview:

1. **Update start and end dates for your sessions (2015-16, summer 2016,...)**
1. **Assign children to the next session they will be attending.**

If you've got that, great! If you'd like a little more detail, here you go:

## Update start and end dates for your sessions

Go to Admin--> Sessions. Click on a session to edit the start and end dates. Even if you are closed for the summer, make sure you have a summer session that is marked "inactive" with the correct start and end dates. This will ensure that we are charging you the correct amount during the summer.

## Assign children to the next session they will be attending

Go to Admin--> Classroom Placement. Here you will see a list of all the current children and what classroom they were in for each session. Choose the session you want to assign in the upper right corner (Summer 2016, 2016-17). If they're staying in the same classroom for that session, simply copy the classroom over. If they're moving on to another classroom, use the drop down menu to select a classroom.

Alternately, you can change or add sessions to a child's profile individually. Select a child and 'edit'. Here you can add a child to another classroom and assign them a session. 

We hope you all have smooth transitions to your summer programs (if you have them) and let us know if you have any questions!
