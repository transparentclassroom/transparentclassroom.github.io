To use the attendance feature to its full capacity there are a few features of which you should be aware.
  1. A child's hours of attendance can be set (and changed).
  2. When you view attendance by month or day you will be able to see any child that is tardy.
  3. A child (or staff member) can be signed in and out multiple times a day. 

To set a child's attendance hours, first go to 'Children' and select 'edit' for the child. Scroll down to 'Normal Hours' and select the drop down menu. If the child's normal hours appear here, select them and you are done. (Attendance-1) If not, select 'choose different hours'. (Attendance-2) Use the toggles to input the child's hours and days of the week that they are at school. Once you save the information will be available on the drop down menu as an option for all subsequent children. 

When you view the attendance by month you will see several columns to the right. (Attendance-3) One says 'late drop off'. Here you will see the number of days that month that the child has been tardy. There is also a column called 'late pick up'. Here you will see the number of days a child has been picked up late. Also, the column next to that tells you how many minutes over time they were.

On the attendance by day page, you will see in red how late a child was. (Attendance-4)

Children (and staff) can be signed in and out several times a day if needed. (Attendance-6) A parent can sign a child in and out from the Drop Off/Pick Up app, or a teacher or assistant can do it from the attendance by day page. Simply click on 'edit' to the right of a child's name and fill out the new event. (Attendance-5)
