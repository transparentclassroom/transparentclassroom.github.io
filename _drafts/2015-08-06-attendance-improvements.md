By popular demand, attendance can now do a bit more than it could last month.


Summer is here! And we're rolling out a new, sleeker design for Transparent Classroom.

Jeremy has been working hard on this new design in order to make TC even more user friendly and easy to use especially on tablets and for larger schools. Never fear, all of our current features will remain, and we're adding a few new ones. 

We hosted a webinar about the new look. But if you missed it, watch it here:
